Reviews ethics statement\nIt's an east-versus-west London derby, with both teams still harboring hopes of European qualification.\nWest Ham host Fulham on Sunday in a London derby in the English Premier League, looking for a much-needed home win to bolster their hopes of a top-six finish.\nThe Hammers come into this match looking to bounce back from a hard-fought 2-0 defeat against Bayer Leverkusen in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday -- a result that's likely to mean their league position now represents their best chance of playing in Europe once again next season.\nMidtable Fulham also still harbor European aspirations, despite those hopes taking a severe dent last weekend following their 1-0 defeat at home to rivals Newcastle. With the hosts likely to be depleted by their midweek excursions in Germany, Cottagers boss Marco Silva will be hoping his side can take advantage and revive those lofty ambitions.\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game live, wherever you are in the world.\nMexican midfielder Edson Álvarez is set to give West Ham's starting 11 a welcome boost with his return from suspension.\nWest Ham United host Fulham  at the London Stadium on Sunday, April 13. Kickoff is set for 2 p.m. BST local time, which is 9 a.m. ET or 6 a.m. PT in the US and Canada, and 11 p.m. AEST in Australia.\nIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch the game -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, and you can sign up for ExpressVPN and save 35% -- the equivalent of $8.32 a month -- if you get an annual subscription.\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nSunday's West Ham-Fulham match is streaming on Peacock. You'll need a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus account to catch the game live.\nNBC's streaming service, Peacock, offers access to all the matches of this season's Premier League that aren't shown on cable. You'll need to have a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus account to stream games live, which costs $6 a month or $60 per year.\nThis game has not been selected to be shown live by any broadcaster in the UK.\nThat also means that if you're in the UK traveling for pleasure or for work, you're unlikely to be able to watch the game like you normally would at home thanks to geo-blocking.\nThere is one option to get around this, however. By using a VPN, as explained above, you can set your location to a country where the match is being broadcast and go from there.\nIf you want to stream West Ham United vs. Fulham live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to Fubo. The service has exclusive rights for this Premier League season.\nFubo is the go-to destination for Canadians looking to watch the EPL this season with exclusive streaming rights to every game. It costs CA$25 per month, though you can save some cash by paying quarterly or annually.\nFootball fans Down Under can watch this EPL fixture on streaming service Optus Sport, which is showing every single Premier League game live in Australia this season.\nWith exclusive rights to screen every EPL match live this season, as well as German Bundesliga and Spanish La Liga games, streaming service Optus Sport is a particularly big draw for Aussie soccer fans.\nIf you're already an Optus network customer you can bag Optus Sport for a reduced price, with discounts bringing the price down to as low as AU$7 per month.
