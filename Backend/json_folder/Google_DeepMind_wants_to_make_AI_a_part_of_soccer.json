But what you can do is notice patterns in tactics. Corners are really good for that because they're rigid, frequent, and lead to goalscoring opportunities.\"\nRelated stories\nTacticAI can make suggestions to coaches about players' optimal positioning when attacking and defending corners, potentially giving their teams the sorts of marginal gains that tend to make big differences in competitive sports.\nDeepMind developed TacticAI with Liverpool, which has won plaudits from legendary \"Moneyball\" baseball executive Billy Beane.\nSince being taken over by Boston Red Sox owners Fenway Sports Group in 2010, the club has hired several people whose CVs you wouldn't typically find in an EPL boardroom — including Ian Graham, who holds a doctorate in physics from Cambridge and who headed up Liverpool's research department until 2023.\nHaving that knowledge on hand helped the collaboration between DeepMind and Liverpool to run smoothly, according to Veličković.\n\"For the past 10 years or so, Liverpool have had people on their team with Ph.D.s from Cambridge and Harvard — these are people who are very engineering, data, and research-minded, and they've worked on using statistical analysis for a long time,\" he said. \"So there was already a good, solid foundation we could build on with deep learning.\"\nLiverpool's experts helped DeepMind to judge whether TacticAI's corner routines were effective, while the two organizations have also teamed up to produce a broader study about AI's role in soccer and a system for predicting players' off-camera movements in recent years.\nThe release of TacticAI marks the end of that collaboration between DeepMind and Liverpool — but the researchers believe that executives at top-level clubs have only just started to realize that AI could play a transformative role in soccer.\nLike corners, other set-piece events, including free-kicks, throw-ins, and penalties, offer up the sort of structured data that AI tends to thrive on and could be the next area that researchers in the field look into, they said.\nSome purists worry that technological interventions like these might one day take some of the joy out of the so-called \"Beautiful Game\" — but the researchers emphasized that they've tried to create a tool that'll make coaches' lives easier rather than put them out of a job.\n\"We're not trying to replace human coaches. Instead, we want to help them make faster and better decisions to help them see patterns and find possible improvements through AI,\" Wang said.\n\"Ultimately, it'll still be the coaches who make the decisions,\" he added. \"This is just a tool to help them make those decisions more comprehensively.\"\nOn February 28, Axel Springer, Business Insider's parent company, joined 31 other media groups and filed a $2.3 billion suit against Google in Dutch court, alleging losses suffered due to the company's advertising practices.\nToday's top stories\nJump to"
