Reviews ethics statement\nIt's a Merseyside derby with major implications for both ends of the table.\nEverton and Liverpool resume their local rivalry on Wednesday, with both sides in big need of a win at Goodison Park.\nLiverpool returned to winning ways on Sunday after claiming a crucial 3-1 win away to Fulham. But title rivals Arsenal now boast a 3-point lead at the top of the table following their 5-0 thrashing of Chelsea on Tuesday, making a win crucial here for the red half of Merseyside.\nEverton, meanwhile, picked up a much-needed win in their battle against relegation in a controversial victory over Nottingham Forest. A win here would open up a comfortable 8-point gap between them and Luton in 18th position.\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game live wherever you are in the world.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold scored a peach of a free kick against Fulham at the weekend.\nEverton host Liverpool at Goodison Park on Wednesday, April 24. Kickoff is set for 8 p.m. BST, which is 3 p.m. ET or 12 p.m. PT in the US and Canada, and 5 a.m. AEST on Thursday, April 25, in Australia.\nIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch the game -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, and you can sign up for ExpressVPN and save 35% -- the equivalent of $8.32 a month -- if you get an annual subscription.\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nWednesday's Everton vs. Liverpool  match is streaming on Peacock. You'll need a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus account to catch the game live.\nNBC's streaming service, Peacock, offers access to all the matches of this season's Premier League that aren't shown on cable. You'll need to have a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus account to stream games live, which costs $6 a month or $60 per year.\nPremier League rights in the UK are split between Sky Sports, Amazon Prime Video and TNT Sports (previously known as BT Sport). Everton vs. Liverpool is exclusive to Sky Sports, showing on its Sky Sports Main Event, Premier League and Ultra channels.
