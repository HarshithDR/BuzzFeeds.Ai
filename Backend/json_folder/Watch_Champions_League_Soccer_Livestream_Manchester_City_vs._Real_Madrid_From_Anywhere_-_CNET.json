Reviews ethics statement\nWill Pep Guardiola or Carlo Ancelotti come out on top in the decisive second leg of this quarterfinal at the Etihad Stadium?\nAfter a thrilling 3-3 draw at the Bernabéu last Tuesday, there's a mouth-watering second leg in store at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday as Man City host Real Madrid -- with a place in the UEFA Champions League semifinals the reward for the victor.\nDefending champs City had looked on course for a memorable away win last week after left-back Joško Gvardiol hit a superb right-foot shot to give the English Premier League side a 3-2 lead in the 71st minute, only for Real to claim a draw via a stunning volley from Federico Valverde eight minutes later.\nAurélien Tchouaméni misses out for Real after picking up a yellow card last week, triggering a suspension, while Ederson is expected to start in goal for the home side in favor of Stefan Ortega, who played in the first leg.\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services for watching every game wherever you are in the world. Viewers in the US can even watch Wednesday's match for free -- if you have an over-the-air antenna connected to your TV.\nCity's Phil Foden, in the form of his life, scored an absolute worldie in the first leg.\nManchester City play Real Madrid at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, April 17. Kickoff is set for 8 p.m. BST local time in the UK, which is 3 p.m. ET or 12 p.m. PT in the US and Canada, and 5 a.m. AEST on Wednesday, April 17, in Australia.\nIf you're unable to view Champions League matches locally, you may need a different way to watch the action; that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN can stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you want an extra layer of privacy for your devices and log-ins while traveling and using various Wi-Fi networks.\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to access the game. If your internet provider or mobile carrier assigns an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can fix that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, nonblackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. Be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it suspects is circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the great VPN deals taking place right now.\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, and you can sign up for ExpressVPN and save 35% -- the equivalent of $8.32 a month -- if you get an annual subscription.\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nWednesday's Man City vs. Real Madrid game is on CBS nationally. The good news for soccer fans is that CBS is available on most of the major live TV streaming services. The least expensive option is Paramount Plus.\nParamount Plus has two main subscription plans in the US: Essential for $6 a month and Premium for $12 a month.   Both offer coverage of the Champions League.\nThe cheaper Essential option has ads for on-demand streaming. It also lacks live CBS feeds and the ability to download shows to watch offline later.
