    "content": "Apple is working to secure an exclusive TV deal with soccer governing organization FIFA, reports The New York Times. FIFA will launch a revamped version of Club World Cup in 2025, and Apple wants the TV rights. Club World Cup 2025 will feature 32 teams from each of the six confederations.\nAn agreement between Apple and FIFA could be announced as soon as this month, and the first tournament will take place in the United States next summer. Apple could be paying around $1 billion, and The New York Times says it is not yet clear if there will be any free-to-air rights. If not, the entire tournament could be available only to Apple TV+ subscribers.\nApple has already shelled out $2.5 billion to secure global broadcasting rights to Major League Soccer. MLS and League Cup games are streamed on ‌Apple TV+‌, with access priced at $14.99 per month or $99 per season for non-subscribers and $12.99 per month or $79 per season for those who subscribe to ‌Apple TV+‌.\nApple sees live sports as a way to lure new customers to the ‌Apple TV+‌ streaming service. In addition to the MLS deal, it has also secured a deal with Major League Baseball. Apple negotiated for NFL Sunday Ticket access, and while that didn't work out, a report from The Athletic suggests that Apple is still in the running to secure some streaming access to NBA games.\nEarlier this year, Apple introduced a dedicated Apple Sports app that allows users to get real-time scores and stats for their favorite teams. The app is able to sync with the My Sports experience in the Apple TV app.\nGet weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.\nOur comprehensive guide highlighting every major new addition in iOS 17, plus how-tos that walk you through using the new features.\nApp Store changes for the EU, new emoji, Podcasts transcripts, and more.\nGet the most out your iPhone 15 with our complete guide to all the new features.\nA deep dive into new features in macOS Sonoma, big and small.\nRevamped models with OLED displays, M3 or M4 chip, and redesigned Magic Keyboard accessory.\nUpdated 10.9-inch model and new 12.9-inch model, M2 chip expected.\nApple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference will kick off with a keynote on June 10.\nExpected to see new AI-focused features and more.
