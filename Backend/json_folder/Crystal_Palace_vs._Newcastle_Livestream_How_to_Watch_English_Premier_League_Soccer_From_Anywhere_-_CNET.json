Reviews ethics statement\nThe Magpies take on the Eagles in an intriguing midtable clash at Selhurst Park.\nNewcastle will be looking to continue their push for a European spot as they travel to south London on Wednesday to face an improving Crystal Palace side.\nThe home side are on a roll under new boss Oliver Glasner, having chalked up a statement win away against Liverpool, followed by a 5-2 thrashing of London rivals West Ham.\nNewcastle are meanwhile on a run of four games undefeated following their impressive 4-0 win over Spurs last time out, and could  place a tighter grip on sixth place and a Europa League spot with an away win here.\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game live wherever you are in the world.\nAlexander Isak is the first Newcastle striker since Alan Shearer in 2003-04 to score more than 20 goals in all competitions in a top-flight campaign.\nCrystal Palace host Newcastle United at Selhurst Park in south London on Wednesday, April 24. Kickoff is set for 8 p.m. GMT (3 p.m. ET, 12 p.m. PT in the US and Canada; and 5 a.m. AEST on Thursday, April 25, in Australia).\nIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch the game -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, and you can sign up for ExpressVPN and save 35% -- the equivalent of $8.32 a month -- if you get an annual subscription.\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nWednesday's Crystal Palace vs. Newcastle United match is streaming on USA Network, which you can access as part of your cable package or at the NBC Sports website with a valid login, and can be streamed via Sling TV and other more expensive streaming TV services.\nSling TV's Blue plan includes USA Network, making it a great option for those wanting to watch Premier League action. It's $40 a month and includes over 40 channels, including other sports channels like ESPN and FS1.\nNo broadcaster has the rights to show this game live in the UK, which means that if you're in the region traveling for pleasure or for work, you're unlikely to be able to watch the game like you normally would at home, thanks to geo-blocking.\nThere is one option to get around this, however. By using a VPN, as explained above, you can set your location to a country where the match is being broadcast and go from there.\nIf you want to stream Crystal Palace vs. Newcastle United live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to Fubo. The service has exclusive rights for this Premier League season.\nFubo is the go-to destination for Canadians looking to watch the EPL this season with exclusive streaming rights to every game. It costs CA$25 a month, though you can save some cash by paying quarterly or annually.\nFootball fans Down Under can watch this EPL fixture on streaming service Optus Sport, which is showing every single Premier League game live in Australia this season.\nWith exclusive rights to screen every EPL match live this season, as well as German Bundesliga and Spanish La Liga games, streaming service Optus Sport is a particularly big draw for Aussie soccer fans.\nIf you're already an Optus network customer you can bag Optus Sport for a reduced price, with discounts bringing the price down to as low as AU$7 per month.
