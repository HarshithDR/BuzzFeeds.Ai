Reviews ethics statement\nThe Reds look to bounce back from a shock Europa League defeat as they host the Eagles.\nLiverpool will be desperate to return to the summit of the English Premier League on Sunday as they host Crystal Palace at Anfield.\nDeparting Reds boss Jürgen Klopp will be looking for a reaction from his players after they crashed to a surprise defeat to Atalanta in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday.\nThe Eagles, meanwhile, will be hoping to inflict a surprise win of their own on Merseyside, with the south Londoners still far from safe from relegation and without a win from their last five fixtures.\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game live, wherever you are in the world.\nMohamed Salah scored a late penalty to even the scores against Man United last weekend.\nLiverpool host Crystal Palace at Anfield on Sunday, April 14. Kickoff is set for 2 p.m. BST local time, which is 9 a.m. ET or 6 a.m. PT in the US and Canada, and 11 p.m. AEST in Australia.\nIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch the game -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, and you can sign up for ExpressVPN and save 35% -- the equivalent of $8.32 a month -- if you get an annual subscription.\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nSunday's Liverpool-Crystal Palace match is streaming on USA Network, which you can access as part of your cable package or at the NBC Sports website with a valid login, and can be streamed via Sling TV and other more expensive streaming TV services.\nSling TV's Blue plan includes USA Network, making it a great option for those wanting to watch Premier League action. It's $40 per month and includes over 40 channels, including other sports channels like ESPN and FS1.\nPremier League rights in the UK are split between Sky Sports, Amazon Prime Video and TNT Sports (previously known as BT Sport). Liverpool vs. Crystal Palace is exclusive to Sky Sports, showing on its Sky Sports Main Event, Premier League and Ultra channels. If you already have Sky Sports as part of your TV package, you can stream the game via its Sky Go app, but cord-cutters will want to get set up with a Now account and a Now Sports membership to stream the game.\nSky subsidiary Now (formerly Now TV) offers streaming access to Sky Sports channels with a Now Sports membership. You can get a day of access for £12, or sign up to a monthly plan from £25 per month right now.\nIf you want to stream Liverpool vs. Crystal Palace live in Canada, you'll need to subscribe to Fubo. The service has exclusive rights for this Premier League season.\nFubo is the go-to destination for Canadians looking to watch the EPL this season with exclusive streaming rights to every game. It costs CA$25 per month, though you can save some cash by paying quarterly or annually.\nFootball fans Down Under can watch this EPL fixture on streaming service Optus Sport, which is showing every single Premier League game live in Australia this season.\nWith exclusive rights to screen every EPL match live this season, as well as German Bundesliga and Spanish La Liga games, streaming service Optus Sport is a particularly big draw for Aussie soccer fans.\nIf you're already an Optus network customer you can bag Optus Sport for a reduced price, with discounts bringing the price down to as low as AU$7 per month. If you're not, a standalone monthly subscription to the service starts at AU$25."
