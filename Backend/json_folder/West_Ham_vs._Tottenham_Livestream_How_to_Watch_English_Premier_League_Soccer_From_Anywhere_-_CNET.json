Reviews ethics statement\nThe Hammers look to bounce back from a dramatic defeat to Newcastle as they host top-four-chasing Spurs.\nLocal bragging rights -- as well as European qualification hopes -- will be on the line in this derby on Tuesday, as West Ham take on Spurs at the London Stadium.\nFour points off sixth-placed Manchester United in the English Premier League, David Moyes' Hammers somehow managed to lose Newcastle on Saturday. Despite taking a 3-1 lead deep into the second half, they capitulated 4-3 to the injury-ravaged Magpies.\nA win against their bitter local rivals would quickly erase memories of that disaster, but another defeat is likely to further increase the discontent among certain sections of the Hammers faithful surrounding Moyes' tenure in east London.\nSpurs, meanwhile, come into this match after battling their way to a 2-1 home win over plucky Luton at the weekend, and another win here will see them leapfrog over fourth-place Aston Villa and raise further hopes of UEFA Champions League qualification for next season.\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to use to watch the game live, wherever you are in the world.\nSon Heung-min's late winner against Luton on Saturday has bolstered Spurs' hopes of finishing in the top four at the end of the season.\nWest Ham United host Tottenham Hotspur at the London Stadium on Tuesday, April 2. Kickoff is set for 8:15 p.m. BST local time, which is 3:15 p.m. ET or 12:15 p.m. PT in the US and Canada, and 6:15 a.m. AEDT in Australia on Wednesday morning.\nIf you find yourself unable to view the game locally, you may need a different way to watch the game -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic, and it's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins.\nWith a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. So if your internet provider or mobile carrier has stuck you with an IP address that incorrectly shows your location in a blackout zone, a VPN can correct that problem by giving you an IP address in your correct, non-blackout area. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this.\nUsing a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Canada, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. You should be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.\nLooking for other options? Be sure to check out some of the other great VPN deals taking place right now.\nExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN, and it works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, and you can sign up for ExpressVPN and save 35% -- the equivalent of $8.32 a month -- if you get an annual subscription.\nNote that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nSaturday's West Ham-Tottenham match is streaming on Peacock. You'll need a Peacock Premium or Premium Plus account to catch the game live.\nNBC's streaming service, Peacock, offers access to all the matches of this season's Premier League that aren't shown on cable.
